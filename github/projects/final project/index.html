            <p>
                School districts in 26 states have banned or opened investigations into books they believe teach
                innappropriate
                topics to students, according to an April report from PEN America, an advocacy organization that
                compiled
                data
                on nationwide book bans over the last 14 months.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            In total, PEN America lists more than 1,500 instances of individual books being banned. The bans affect
            students
            in 26 states and impact more than 1,100 unique book titles. The index includes books that have been banned
            across 86 school districts that enroll over 2 million students.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the 26 states with documented bans, Texas leads in both the number of districts that have enacted bans
            and
            the highest number of individual bans. The state has banned 713 individual titles since March 2021,
            according to
            PEN.
        </p>

                alt="A red graph showing how Texas, Pennsylvania and Florida as the top three states with the highest number of banned books, including bans that are pending investigation.">
        </div>

        <!--   State bar graph  -->

        <p>
            The organization counted actions that lead to the removal of books for at least a day and found that
            Florida,
            Pennsylvania and Texas accounted for the vast majority of book bans across the county. The three states have
            had
            more than 1,300 instances of book bans, or 87 percent of the roughly 1,500 banning incidents that PEN
            America
            tallied.
        </p>
        <p>
            More than 40 percent of the bans are tied to directives from elected lawmakers to investigate or remove
            books.
            These directives include an October request from a Republican state lawmaker in Texas that sent a list of
            850
            books to school districts in the state and asked officials to investigate “material that might make students
            feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex.”

        </div>

        <h1><b>A Changing Legislative Landscape</b></h1>
        <p>
            Other bans have resulted from legislation that bars schools from teaching students about topics related to
            diversity and equity, such as the study of racism and inequality, as well as issued surrounding sexuality
            and
            gender identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Florida law signed in March is among the most high profile examples of legislators intervening in school
            curriculum. The law – which critics have dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill – prohibits classroom instruction
            about
            sexual orientation and gender identity in the state’s public schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another law passed in Tennessee will require school libraries to determine whether books are age
            appropriate,
            while a law pending in Georgia would give principals the power to remove “obscene” books from schools.
        </p>
        <p>
            The legislative and school board actions that have been taken against certain books spiked in late 2021 and
            early 2021. More than half of all book banning incidents that PEN America tallied happened in September and
            December of 2021, coinciding with legislative implementation of aforementioned laws in Tennessee and Texas.

        <h1><b>Attacks on LGBTQ+ Characters and Stories</b></h1>
        <p>
            In the most recent wave of book banning across the country, school administrators have taken aim at books
            that
            confront LGBTQ+ representation, particularly those that touch on topics of gender identity and queerness.
            The
            most banned books in the nation each confront themes of race, queerness and the frequent overlap between
            these
            identities.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            Of the titles that PEN America indexed, 33 percent explicitly address LGBTQ+ themes or have protagonists or
            prominent secondary characters who are members of the LGBTQ+ community. Another 107 titles have themes
            related
            to rights and activism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of the most banned books across the nation explicitly confront gender and sexuality. The most banned
            book –
            "Gender Queer: A Memoir" by Maia Kobabe – is a graphic novel that started as a way for the author to
            describe
            to
            eir family what it means to be gender queer and asexual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simon and Schuester described Kobabe’s work as “a useful and touching guide on gender identity—what it means
            and
            how to think about it.” But the book has been challenged 30 times across the country in the last year.
        </p>
        <p>
            In November, Texas Governor Greg Abbott sent a letter to the Texas Association of School Boards asking it to
            remove what he described as “pornographic” materials from school districts. In calling on the state to
            develop
            standards for evaluation, Abbott singled out "Gender Queer" for its content.

        <p>
            Some experts see the current attack on books by and for the LGBTQ+ community as particularly troubling.
            Shannon
            Neal, a first year graduate student at the University of Maryland and graduate assistant at the university
            library’s comparative studies center, said banning books with identity-based topics fosters learned
            intolerance
            for students.
        </p>
        <p>
            “It’s just very limiting to students. Having [these books] off the library shelves means you can’t just
            discover
            topics of racism, misogyny, antisemitism,” they said. “It also just creates this atmosphere of taboo, which
            doesn’t help with academic freedom or learning.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When a book is taken out of the classroom, it usually takes place when students are in the middle of reading
            it, Neal said.
            Students suffer from not getting to have a full lesson plan surrounding the challenging topics of some books
            when they are removed, which increases the chance they could develop misconceptions about taboo topics like
            sexualiy and gender queerness, they added.

        <h1><b>The Long History of Racial Unrest and Literature</b></h1>
        <p>
            Other books have been banned because of what Neal calls “anti-white” and “anti-police” messaging. One
            prominent banned book – “The Hate U Give” by Angie Thomas – depicts racism, classism and opens with a scene
            of police violence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neal said she was disappointed, but not surprised at the recent wave of book banning that has taken hold
            across
            the nation in the last year.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We all feel the political atmosphere right now, And I don't know how surprising it is to anyone, honestly.
            It's
            deeply disappointing,” Neal said. “I am definitely concerned. I don't know where we're heading.”

        <p>
            Books with themes of race and class have also helped students grapple with the country’s history of racism
            and
            slavery for more than a century, said Tahirah Akbar-Williams, the librarian for the University of Maryland’s
            schools of education and African American studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up in an all-white neighborhood, Akbar-Williams did not have candid conversations with her
            classmates
            about her blackness until a teacher had her class read Harper Lee’s "To Kill A Mockingbird" – a book that
            has
            been
            challenged and banned dozens of times since its release in 1960.
        </p>

        <!-- to kill a mockingbird photo -->

        <p>
            “That book was pivotal in helping people understand racism, racial relations, violence against black bodies,
            and
            identity,” Akbar-Williams said. “It's important to include that perspective in K-12 learning and have those
            discussions that inform citizens and give them a better perspective and understanding of the country they
            live
            in.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Many districts have banned both fiction and nonfiction books like “The Hate U Give,” and “How to be an
            Antiracist” out of fear their children would be indoctrinated into a mindset of Critical Race Theory – an
            idea that race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias,
            but also something embedded in the fabric of the nation. Book banning contributes to misinformed ideas
            around
            the nation about racial justice initiatives and Critical Race Theory itself, Akbar-Williams said.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I saw a guy on TV, he said ‘I just don’t want my kid to feel bad about being white.’ And I thought that’s
            not
            critical race theory, and that’s problematic,” Akbar-Williams said. “And so if you banned the book, how will
            people ever know what critical race theory is?”

            Akbar-Williams sees the nationwide push to outlaw books about underrepresented groups as a backlash against
            social justice progress that has been made since the death of George Floyd in 2020 and the legalization of
            gay
            marriage.

            Having books could help Americans to progress their political and social conversations toward a more equal
            and
            accepting society, but the overwhelming power of white supremacy in this country diminishes those
            conversations,
            Akbar-Williams said. The discomfort of lawmakers and school boards around sensitive issues will cause the
            nation’s book banning “crisis” to continue, she added.

                “We won't even talk about it. Racism doesn't exist. That's what the parents are saying: ‘I don't want my
                white
                kids to be uncomfortable that my uncle or my brother is saying the N-word and killing black people in
                the
                car,’”
                Akbar-Williams said. “When power gets uncomfortable, it will strike back, no matter what.”
