            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a U.S. National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It
                extends for 42 miles along the shore of Lake Superior and covers 73,236 acres. The shore has picturesque
                rock formations, waterfalls and sand dunes. </p>
            <p>The lakeshore derives its name from the 15 miles of colorful sandstone cliffs just northeast of Munising,
                Michigan. The cliffs reach up to 200 feet avoe lake level. They have been naturally sculpted into a
                variety of caves, arches and formations resembling castle turrets and humans.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Congress designated Pictured Rocks the first National Lakeshore in the United States in 1966. It
                is governed by the National Park Service.</p>

        <section class="geology">
            <h2>Geology</h2>
            <p>The colors of the cliffs are created by the large amounts of minerals in the rock. The cliffs are
                composed of
                the
                Munising Formation of 500-million-year-old Cambrian Period sandstone. The Munising Formation sits atop
                Precambrian Sandstone of the Jacobsville Formation. The mottled red Jacobsville Formation is the oldest
                rock
                in
                the park. On top of the Munising formation, acting as a cap over the other layers, is the hard sandstone
                of
                the
                younger Au Train Formation from the Ordovician Period. Streaks on the face of the cliffs come from
                groundwater
                leaching out of the rock and evaporating, leaving streaks of iron (red), manganese (black-white),
                limonite
                (yellow-brown), copper (pink-green) and other minerals. </p>

        <section class="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Although the Pictured Rocks shore waters are a rich fishing ground, the sandstone cliffs are dangerous
                to
                canoes
                and other open boats skirting the coastline. In 1658, the fur trader Pierre Esprit Radisson made this
                risky
                passage and noted that his Native American companions made an offering of tobacco to the local spirit of
                the
                cliffs.</p>
            <p>During the Romantic Era of the 1800s, a series of American writers described their feelings upon sight of
                the
                Pictured Rocks. Geologist and US Indian Agent Henry Rowe Schoolcraft visited in 1820 and remarked upon
                "some
                of
                the most subline and commanding views in nature."</p>
            <p>After the lumbering era ended around 1910, much of the land making up the current National Lakeshore
                reverted
                to
                the state of Michigan for unpaid property taxes. Eager for federal help and recognition, the state
                cooperated
                with the federal government in the region's redevelopment. In October 1966, Congress passed a bill
                authorizing
                the establishment of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore "in order to preserve for the benefit,
                inspiration,
                education, recreational use and enjoyment of the publish, a significant portion of the diminishing
                shoreline
                of
                the United States and its related geographic and scientific features."</p>
            <p> On April 13, 2006, one of the named rock formations collapsed: the Inner Turret of Miner's Castle in the
                Munising Formation. The collapse was reported via cell phone by fishermen in the area, according to
                chief
                ranger
                Larry Hach.</p>

        <section class="accessibility">
            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Munising, on the western end of the lakeshore, is accessed by M-28 and M-94. Grand Marais, on the eastern
                end, is
                reached by M-77.</p>
            <p> Paved highways penetrate into the Lakeshore from both ends, connected by County Road H-58. Roads come
                close
                to
                the shortline only near it's key attractions, such as Miners Castle, 12 Mile Beach and the Grand Sable
                Dunes.
                The rest of the shoreline is seen from land only by hiking. A 42-mile section of the North County Trail
                spans
                the lakeshore. A permit is needed for backcountry camping, which is allowed along many miles of the
                shore.
            </p>
            <p> Many boat companies offer daily trips along the shoreline from Memorial Day weekend through the fall
                season.
                Sea
                kayaking is another popular way to explore the park. While this may be the best way to see the natural
                formations, it is a strenuous trip in cold, dangerous water, not to be undertaken lightly or without
                proper
                equipment. Rock arches and sea caves are popular attractions for kayakers and boat tourists. Guide are
                also
                available for these tours. The most efficient port of entry for kayaks is the Miner's Beach or the
                harbor at
                Munising. In addition, pontoons can be cheaply rented locally. </p>
