    <h1>Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is a U.S. National Lakeshore in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It extends
        for
        42 miles along the shore of Lake Superior and covers 73,236 acres. The shore has picturesque rock formations,
        waterfalls and sand dunes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lakeshore derives its name from the 15 miles of colorful sandstone cliffs just northeast of Munising,
        Michigan. The cliffs reach up to 200 feet avoe lake level. They have been naturally sculpted into a variety of
        caves, arches and formations resembling castle turrets and humans.

        The U.S. Congress designated Pictured Rocks the first National Lakeshore in the United States in 1966. It is
        governed by the National Park Service.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Although the Pictured Rocks shore waters are a rich fishing ground, the sandstone cliffs are dangerous to canoes
        and other open boats skirting the coastline. In 1658, the fur trader Pierre Esprit Radisson made this risky
        passage and noted that his Native American companions made an offering of tobacco to the local spirit of the
        cliffs.

        During the Romantic Era of the 1800s, a series of American writers described their feelings upon sight of the
        Pictured Rocks. Geologist and US Indian Agent Henry Rowe Schoolcraft visited in 1820 and remarked upon "some of
        the most subline and commanding views in nature."

        After the lumbering era ended around 1910, much of the land making up the current National Lakeshore reverted to
        the state of Michigan for unpaid property taxes. Eager for federal help and recognition, the state cooperated
        with the federal government in the region's redevelopment. In October 1966, Congress passed a bill authorizing
        the establishment of the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore "in order to preserve for the benefit, inspiration,
        education, recreational use and enjoyment of the publish, a significant portion of the diminishing shoreline of
        the United States and its related geographic and scientific features."

        On April 13, 2006, one of the named rock formations collapsed: the Inner Turret of Miner's Castle in the
        Munising Formation. The collapse was reported via cell phone by fishermen in the area, according to chief ranger
        Larry Hach. Miners Castle
